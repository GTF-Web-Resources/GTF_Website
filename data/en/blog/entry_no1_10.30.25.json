    "paragraph": "Sysco hosted one of their food shows in Walnut today, and right from the start we were greeted by some familiar household names — Red Bull (complete with their eye-catching Mini Cooper truck), McCain, and Coca-Cola — along with plenty of exciting newcomers making their debut.<br><br>Given how hot it was, it felt only right that the first booths we encountered were all about drinks and barbecue. After realizing that a few bottles of Jarritos weren’t enough to fend off the blistering heat, we made our way indoors to the heart of the show.<br><br>The path to the main showroom took us through a hallway lined with Sysco’s test kitchens, where chefs were hard at work creating and plating new dishes for visitors to sample.<br><br>Inside, the showroom was everything you’d expect — vibrant booth designs, stacks of brochures and flyers, and of course, an endless spread of food. We even spotted Twinkies making an appearance.<br><br>Overall, the show offered a great look at where the food industry is headed, from innovative ingredients to creative supply solutions. And after all was said and done, I still can’t stop thinking about that Red Bull Mini Cooper."
